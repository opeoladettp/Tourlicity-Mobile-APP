# File Picker Implementation Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Naming Conflicts Fixed
- **Problem**: `PickedFile` class name conflict between `image_picker` package and our custom `file_picker_service.dart`
- **Solution**: Added import prefix `as fps` to our file picker service imports
- **Files Updated**:
  - `lib/widgets/common/file_picker_widget.dart`
  - `lib/widgets/common/image_picker_widget.dart`

### 2. Deprecated Method Usage Fixed
- **Problem**: `withOpacity()` method deprecated in favor of `withValues()`
- **Solution**: Updated to use `color.withValues(alpha: 0.1)` instead of `color.withOpacity(0.1)`
- **Files Updated**:
  - `lib/widgets/common/file_picker_widget.dart`

### 3. Unnecessary Import Removed
- **Problem**: Redundant `dart:typed_data` import in file picker service
- **Solution**: Removed unnecessary import as `Uint8List` is available through `package:flutter/foundation.dart`
- **Files Updated**:
  - `lib/services/file_picker_service.dart`

### 4. File Upload Service API Integration Fixed
- **Problem**: Incorrect usage of ApiService for file uploads with progress tracking
- **Solution**: Created dedicated Dio instance in FileUploadService with proper auth interceptor
- **Files Updated**:
  - `lib/services/file_upload_service.dart`

## Technical Improvements

### Import Prefixes Used
```dart
import '../../services/file_picker_service.dart' as fps;
```

### Updated Type References
- `PickedFile` → `fps.PickedFile`
- `FilePickerService` → `fps.FilePickerService`

### Modern Flutter API Usage
- `withOpacity(0.1)` → `withValues(alpha: 0.1)`

### Proper Dio Integration
- Direct Dio instance for file uploads with progress tracking
- Auth token interceptor for authenticated uploads
- Proper error handling and logging
