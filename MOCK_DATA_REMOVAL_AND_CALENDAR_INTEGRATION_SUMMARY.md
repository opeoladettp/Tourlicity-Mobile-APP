### 5. Routing Updates
- **Updated**: `lib/config/routes.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added route for tour template activities: `/tour-template-activities/:templateId`
  - Added import for TourTemplateActivitiesScreen

### 6. Mock Data Removal
- **Updated**: `lib/services/dashboard_service.dart`
  - Removed comment about "mock data for offline testing"
  - Changed to return empty data instead of mock data

- **Updated**: `lib/screens/tourist/tourist_dashboard_screen.dart`
  - Removed mock join tour functionality
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback

- **Updated**: `lib/widgets/common/settings_dropdown.dart`
  - Removed TODO comment
  - Updated message to indicate backend integration needed

- **Updated**: `lib/services/custom_push_notification_service.dart`
  - Removed TODO comment from navigation logic

- **Updated**: `lib/screens/tourist/tour_template_browse_screen.dart`

## API Integration Points

### Calendar Entries API
The implementation uses the following API endpoints from the backend:

1. **GET /calendar** - Get calendar entries
2. **GET /calendar/default-activities** - Get default activities
3. **GET /calendar/:id** - Get calendar entry by ID
4. **POST /calendar** - Create calendar entry
5. **PUT /calendar/:id** - Update calendar entry
6. **DELETE /calendar/:id** - Delete calendar entry

### System Statistics API
The implementation fetches data from:

1. **GET /users** - For total users count
2. **GET /providers** - For active providers count
3. **GET /custom-tours** - For total tours count
4. **GET /role-change-requests** - For pending reviews count

## Calendar Entry Model
The CalendarEntry model supports all required fields:
- id, title, description
- startTime, endTime, location
- activityType, customTourId, providerId
- isDefaultActivity flag
- createdDate, updatedDate

## User Experience Improvements

### System Admin Dashboard
- Real-time statistics instead of static mock numbers
- Refresh capability for up-to-date information
- Loading states for better user feedback
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Tour Template Management
- Comprehensive activity management per template
- Intuitive UI for adding/editing activities
- Default activities library for quick setup
- Time-based scheduling with date/time pickers
- Activity categorization with predefined types

### Data Integrity
- All mock data removed from the system
- Proper error handling when APIs are unavailable
- Consistent user feedback for all operations
- No hardcoded values remaining in the codebase

## Technical Improvements
- Fixed deprecated Flutter widget properties
- Improved state management with proper loading states
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Consistent code structure and naming conventions
- Proper navigation between related screens

## Next Steps
1. Backend API integration testing
2. User acceptance testing for activity management
3. Performance optimization for large datasets
4. Additional activity types if needed
5. Bulk operations for activity management
