# Profile Data Response Structure Fix

## Problem Identified

The user profile data was showing as null even though the API was returning the correct data. The issue was in the response structure parsing.

## Root Cause Analysis

From the debug logs, we can see:

1. **API Response Structure**: The `/auth/profile` endpoint returns:
   ```json
   {
     "user": {
       "_id": "68d26ed7d0b8d61e6ba081b4",
       "email": "opeyemioladejobi@gmail.com",
       "user_type": "system_admin",
       "first_name": "Opeyemi",
       "last_name": "Oladejobi",
       "phone_number": "08189273082",
       "country": "Nigeria",
       "date_of_birth": "1991-09-04T00:00:00.000Z",
       // ... other fields
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Frontend Parsing Issue**: The `getCurrentUser()` method was checking for a `data` key but the API returns a `user` key:
   ```dart
   // OLD CODE (incorrect)
   final userData = data.containsKey('data') ? data['data'] : data;
   
   // This was trying to parse the entire response object instead of just the user data
   ```

3. **Result**: The `User.fromJson()` method was receiving the entire response object `{user: {...}}` instead of just the user data `{...}`, causing all fields to be null.

## Fix Applied

Updated `lib/services/auth_service.dart` in the `getCurrentUser()` method:

```dart
// NEW CODE (correct)
final userData = data.containsKey('user') ? data['user'] : 
                data.containsKey('data') ? data['data'] : data;
```

This change:
1. **First checks for 'user' key** (standard API response format)
2. **Falls back to 'data' key** (for compatibility)
3. **Uses entire response as fallback** (for edge cases)

## API Documentation Reference

According to the Tourlicity Backend API Documentation, the `/auth/profile` endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "_id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "first_name": "...",
    "last_name": "...",
    "phone_number": "...",
    "profile_picture": "...",
    "user_type": "...",
    "is_active": true,
    "created_date": "...",
    "updated_date": "...",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

## Expected Result

After this fix, the user should see:
- **First Name**: "Opeyemi" (instead of null)
- **Last Name**: "Oladejobi" (instead of null)  
- **Phone Number**: "08189273082" (instead of null)
- **Country**: "Nigeria" (instead of null)
- **Date of Birth**: September 4, 1991 (instead of null)
- **User Type**: "system_admin" (instead of "tourist")

Since this user is a `system_admin`, they should bypass profile completion and go directly to the admin dashboard.

## Other Methods Already Fixed

The following methods were already correctly handling the `user` key:
- ✅ `signInWithGoogle()` - correctly checks for `data['user']`
- ✅ `updateProfile()` - correctly checks for `data['user']`
- ✅ `resetToGoogleProfilePicture()` - correctly checks for `data['user']`

Only `getCurrentUser()` had the incorrect key checking logic.

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. **Run the app** - should now show correct profile data
2. **Check logs** - should see actual user data instead of null values
3. **Profile completion** - system_admin users should bypass completion screen
4. **Navigation** - should go to admin dashboard instead of profile completion

## Prevention

This issue occurred because:
1. **API documentation wasn't referenced** during implementation
2. **Response structure assumptions** were made without verification
3. **Debug logging** helped identify the exact issue

**Future Prevention**:
- Always reference API documentation for response structures
- Add response structure validation in development
- Use consistent response parsing patterns across all API methods
