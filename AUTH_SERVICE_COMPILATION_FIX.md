# AuthService Compilation Fix

## Problem
The AuthProvider was showing compilation errors:
```
The method 'clearCache' isn't defined for the type 'AuthService'
The method 'updateProfile' isn't defined for the type 'AuthService'  
The method 'resetToGoogleProfilePicture' isn't defined for the type 'AuthService'
```

## Root Cause
The `lib/services/auth_service.dart` file had **structural syntax errors** that prevented the class methods from being properly recognized by the Dart analyzer:

1. **Broken class structure** around line 224
2. **Missing method definitions** due to syntax corruption
3. **Malformed static method declarations**
4. **Incomplete class closing braces**

## Fix Applied

### 1. Complete AuthService Rewrite
Recreated the entire `lib/services/auth_service.dart` file with proper structure:

```dart
class AuthService {
  final ApiService _apiService = ApiService();
  final GoogleSignIn _googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
    scopes: AppConfig.googleSignInScopes,
  );
  
  // Cache to prevent duplicate profile requests
  static User? _cachedUser;
  static DateTime? _lastProfileFetch;
  static const Duration _profileCacheTimeout = Duration(minutes: 2);
  static Future<User?>? _ongoingProfileRequest;

  // All methods properly defined...
}
```

### 2. Restored All Required Methods
- ✅ `signInWithGoogle()` - Google OAuth authentication
- ✅ `signOut()` - User logout
- ✅ `getCurrentUser()` - Get current user with caching
- ✅ `updateProfile()` - Update user profile
- ✅ `resetToGoogleProfilePicture()` - Reset profile picture
- ✅ `clearCache()` -
