- **Type-Based Navigation**:
  - Different actions based on notification type
  - Tour update navigation (to be implemented)
  - System announcement dialogs

## API Integration

### Backend Endpoints Used
The system integrates with the following Tourlicity Backend API endpoints:

1. **POST /notifications/send** - Send notification to specific user
2. **POST /notifications/send-bulk** - Send bulk notifications by user type
3. **GET /notifications/queue-stats** - Get notification queue statistics
4. **POST /notifications/cleanup** - Clean up notification queues
5. **GET /notifications/all-subscriptions** - Get all push subscriptions
6. **GET /users** - Load users for individual targeting

### Notification Types Supported
- `system_announcement` - General system announcements
- `tour_update` - Tour-related updates and changes
- `maintenance` - System maintenance notices
- `promotion` - Promotional messages and offers
- `urgent` - Urgent notifications requiring immediate attention
- `general` - General information messages

## User Experience Features

### For System Administrators
- **Intuitive Broadcast Interface**: Easy-to-use form with clear recipient selection
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation and status updates
- **Comprehensive Management**: Full oversight of notification system health
- **Quick Actions**: Fast access to common notification tasks

### For All Users
- **Unified Notification Center**: Single location for all notifications
- **Smart Filtering**: Easy organization of notifications by status
- **Interactive Management**: Swipe gestures and bulk actions
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear read/unread status and type identification

## Navigation Integration

### Admin Dashboard
- Added "Notifications" card linking to notification management
- Replaced generic "System Settings" with notification functionality

### Navigation Drawer
- Added "Notifications" item for all user types
- System admins see "Notifications" linking to management screen
- All users can access their personal notifications

### Routing
- `/notification-management` - Admin notification management
- `/broadcast-notification` - Admin broadcast interface  
- `/notifications` - User notification center

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Proper loading states for all async operations
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Data Flow
1. Admin composes notification in broadcast screen
2. System validates recipient selection and message content
3. API calls made to appropriate backend endpoints
4. Users receive notifications via push/email
5. Users view notifications in unified notification center

### Error Handling
- Network error recovery with retry options
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- User feedback for all error conditions

## Security Considerations
- System admin role verification for broadcast functionality
- User data protection in recipient selection
- Secure API communication for all notification operations

## Future Enhancements
1. **Rich Notifications**: Support for images and action buttons
2. **Scheduling**: Ability to schedule notifications for future delivery
3. **Templates**: Pre-defined notification templates for common messages
4. **Analytics**: Notification delivery and engagement metrics
5. **Personalization**: User preferences for notification types and delivery methods

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test notification delivery to all user types
2. Verify queue management and cleanup functionality
3. Test notification display and interaction on different devices
4. Validate form submission with various recipient combinations
5. Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

This implementation provides a complete notification broadcasting system that enhances communication between system administrators and users while maintaining a clean, intuitive user experience.
