# Android Build Desugaring Fix

## Issue
Build was failing with the following error:
```
Dependency ':flutter_local_notifications' requires core library desugaring to be enabled for :app.
```

## Root Cause
The `flutter_local_notifications` package requires core library desugaring to be enabled in the Android build configuration. This allows the use of newer Java APIs on older Android versions.

## Solution Applied

### Updated android/app/build.gradle.kts

1. **Enabled Core Library Desugaring**:
   ```kotlin
   compileOptions {
       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
   }
   ```

2. **Added Desugaring Dependency**:
   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4")
   }
   ```

## What Core Library Desugaring Does
- Allows using newer Java 8+ APIs on older Android versions
- Required by some Flutter packages like `flutter_local_notifications`
- Enables backward compatibility for modern Java features

## Next Steps
1. Run `flutter clean` (completed)
2. Run `flutter pub get` (completed)
3. Try building the app again with `flutter run`

## Status
âœ… **APPLIED** - Android build configuration updated to support core library desugaring
