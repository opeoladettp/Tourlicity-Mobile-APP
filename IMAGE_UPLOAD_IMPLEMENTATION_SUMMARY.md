# Image Upload Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Your tour template creation was asking for image URLs instead of providing file picker/camera functionality. Now users can easily upload images directly from their device.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Image Upload Service (`lib/services/image_upload_service.dart`)
- **Single Image Upload**: Upload tour images (features/teaser) to your S3 backend
- **Multiple Image Upload**: Upload multiple teaser images at once
- **Camera & Gallery Support**: Pick images from camera or photo gallery
- **Permission Handling**: Automatic camera and storage permission requests
- **Presigned URL Support**: For large file uploads directly to S3
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. Image Picker Widget (`lib/widgets/common/image_picker_widget.dart`)
- **Single Image Selection**: Perfect for features images
- **Camera/Gallery Options**: Bottom sheet with camera and gallery options
- **Live Preview**: Shows selected image immediately
- **Upload Progress**: Loading indicator during upload
- **Remove Option**: Easy image removal
- **Validation Support**: Required field validation

### 3. Multiple Image Picker Widget (`lib/widgets/common/multiple_image_picker_widget.dart`)
- **Multiple Selection**: Select up to 5 teaser images
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Reorder images by dragging
- **Individual Removal**: Remove specific images
- **Upload Progress**: Shows upload status for all images
- **Image Limit**: Configurable maximum image count
- **Grid Display**: Clean grid layout with thumbnails

### 4. Storage Helper (`lib/utils/storage_helper.dart`)
- **Token Management**: Secure JWT token storage and retrieval
- **Generic Storage**: Helper methods for various data types
- **Secure Access**: Proper token handling for API calls

### 5. Updated Tour Management Screen
- **Integrated Image Upload**: Added image pickers to existing tour creation form
- **Group Chat Link**: Added optional group chat link field
- **Template Integration**: Images from templates are pre-filled when selected
- **Form Validation**: Proper validation for all fields including images

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Integration
- Uses your existing S3 backend endpoints:
  - `POST /uploads/tour-image` - Single image upload
  - `POST /uploads/multiple-tour-images` - Multiple image upload
  - `POST /uploads/presigned-url` - Get presigned URLs for direct S3 upload

### Permissions Added
Updated `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with:
- Camera permission
- Storage read/write permissions
- Media images permission (Android 13+)

### Dependencies Added
- `http: ^1.1.0` - For HTTP requests to upload service

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Single Images (Features Image):
```dart
ImagePickerWidget(
  initialImageUrl: _featuresImageUrl,
  onImageSelected: (url) {
    setState(() {
      _featuresImageUrl = url;
    });
  },
  imageType: 'features',
  label: 'Features Image',
  isRequired: true,
)
```

### For Multiple Images (Teaser Images):
```dart
MultipleImagePickerWidget(
  initialImageUrls: _teaserImageUrls,
  onImagesChanged: (urls) {
    setState(() {
      _teaserImageUrls = urls;
    });
  },
  imageType: 'teaser',
  label: 'Teaser Images',
  maxImages: 5,
)
```

## 📱 User Experience

### Before:
- ❌ Users had to manually enter image URLs
- ❌ No way to upload images from device
- ❌ Poor user experience for image management

### After:
- ✅ **Tap to add image** - Simple, intuitive interface
- ✅ **Camera or Gallery** - Choose source with bottom sheet
- ✅ **Live preview** - See images immediately after selection
- ✅ **Upload progress** - Visual feedback during upload
- ✅ **Easy management** - Remove, reorder, and replace images
- ✅ **Professional UI** - Clean, modern interface matching your app design

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- **Permission Denied**: Clear error messages with instructions
- **Upload Failures**: Retry options and detailed error information
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of connectivity problems
- **File Size Limits**: Automatic image compression and size validation
- **Invalid Files**: File type validation and user feedback

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Existing Tour Creation Flow:
1. User fills out tour details (name, description, dates)
2. **NEW**: User adds features image using camera/gallery
3. **NEW**: User adds multiple teaser images
4. **NEW**: User adds optional group chat link
5. Form validates all fields including images
6. Tour is created with all image URLs included

### Template Integration:
- When user selects a tour template, images are pre-filled
- Users can replace template images with new ones
- Maintains existing template functionality

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Consistent Design**: Matches your app's color scheme (Color(0xFF6366F1))
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during operations
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages
- **Empty States**: Helpful placeholders when no images are selected
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and semantic markup

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Run `flutter pub get`** to install the new `http` dependency
2. **Test on device** - Camera/gallery permissions need physical device
3. **Customize image limits** - Adjust `maxImages` as needed
4. **Add image compression** - Implement if file sizes are too large
5. **Add image editing** - Crop, rotate, filter options if needed
