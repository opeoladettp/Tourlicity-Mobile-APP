# Profile and UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. User Profile Data Showing Null Values

**Problem**: User profile data was showing null values even though data exists in the database.

**Root Cause**: The navigation drawer was using `user?.name` which doesn't exist in the User model. The correct property is `fullName`.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `lib/widgets/common/navigation_drawer.dart`:
  - Changed `user?.name ?? 'Tourist'` to `user?.fullName.isNotEmpty == true ? user!.fullName : 'Tourist'`
  - Updated avatar initial letter logic to use `fullName` instead of `name`
- Added user data refresh in `lib/screens/dashboard/unified_dashboard_screen.dart`:
  - Added `authProvider.refreshUser()` call in `initState()` to ensure fresh user data

### 2. Notification Bell Using Real Data

**Status**: The notification system is already properly implemented and using real data from the backend.

**Current Implementation**:
- `lib/widgets/common/notification_icon.dart` uses `UserNotificationService`
- `UserNotificationService` generates notifications from real user activity:
  - Tour registrations
  - Broadcast messages
  - Role change requests
  - System notifications
- Falls back to mock data only when API calls fail
- Properly handles unread counts and notification management

### 3. Tour Template Activities - Error Dialog Z-Index Issue

**Problem**: Error popup was appearing behind calendar overlay when validation failed.

**Root Cause**: Showing a dialog inside another dialog causes z-index stacking issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `lib/screens/admin/tour_template_activities_screen.dart`:
  - Replaced nested `showDialog()` for time validation with `ScaffoldMessenger.showSnackBar()`
  - This prevents z-index conflicts and provides better UX

### 4. Tour Template Activities - Adding Activities

**Current Status**: The implementation is correct but may have backend integration issues.

**Implementation Details**:
- Activities are created using `CalendarService.createCalendarEntry()`
- Template ID is passed as `customTourId` parameter
- Activities are filtered by `customTourId == templateId` when loading
- Added better error logging to help diagnose backend issues

**Potential Issues**:
- Backend may not recognize template IDs as valid tour IDs
- API endpoint `/calendar` may need different parameters for template activities
- Consider creating a separate endpoint for template activities if needed

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout the application
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Added graceful fallbacks for API failures

### 2. User Experience
- Fixed profile data display issues
- Improved notification system reliability
- Fixed dialog stacking issues
- Added loading states and proper feedback

### 3. Data Management
- Added user data refresh mechanisms
- Improved notification data flow
- Better error recovery for failed API calls

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Profile Data**: Test user profile display after login to ensure all fields show correctly
2. **Notifications**: Verify notification bell shows real data and updates properly
3. **Tour Templates**: Test adding activities to templates and check for proper error messages
4. **Error Dialogs**: Verify no dialogs appear behind other UI elements

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: If tour template activities still fail, consider:
   - Creating a dedicated API endpoint for template activities
   - Modifying the calendar endpoint to handle template IDs
   - Adding template-specific activity management

2. **Profile Data**: Monitor for any remaining null value issues and add additional validation

3. **Notifications**: Consider implementing real-time notification updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

4. **Performance**: Add caching for frequently accessed data like user profiles and notifications
