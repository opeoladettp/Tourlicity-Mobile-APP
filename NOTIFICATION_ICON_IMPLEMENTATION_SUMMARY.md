# Notification Icon Implementation Summary

## Overview
Replaced the settings dropdown icon in dashboard app bars with a notification icon that provides easy access to notifications and shows unread notification counts. This improves user experience by making notifications more prominent and accessible.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Notification Icon Widget (`lib/widgets/common/notification_icon.dart`)
**Purpose**: Provides a notification icon with badge and dropdown menu for quick notification access

  - Refresh (reloads notifications)
- **Recent Notifications Preview**: Shows up to 3 recent unread notifications with:
  - Type-specific icons and colors
  - Truncated title and body text
  - Relative timestamps
- **Empty State**: Shows "No new notifications" when no unread notifications exist

### 2. Created App Bar Actions Widget (`lib/widgets/common/app_bar_actions.dart`)
**Purpose**: Provides flexible app bar action combinations for different screen types

**Components**:
- **AppBarActions**: Base widget with configurable notification and settings options
